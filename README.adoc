= Algorithm Contest

This repository holds the code for an algorithm competition where programmers
and math puzzle enthusiasts can compete by writing an algorithm to solve a
math puzzle using as little "computational cost" as possible.

A python utility is supplied which allows anyone to easily test their
algorithm to verify its correctness as well as have its computational cost
calculated with some example inputs.

The contest documentaion can be read here:
https://algorithmcompetition.github.io/index.html

Or you can try browsing the site's adoc files directly in
`site-docs/modules/contest/pages`.
