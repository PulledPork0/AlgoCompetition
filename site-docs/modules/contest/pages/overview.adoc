This algorithm competition allows programmers and math puzzle enthusiasts to
compete by writing an algorithm in python to solve a math puzzle using as
little "computational cost" as possible.

A python utility is supplied which allows anyone to easily test their
algorithm to verify its correctness as well as have its computational cost
calculated with some example inputs.

The contest ends on August 31, 2020. The submissions will then be
officially tested and the entry which uses the least amount of computational
cost to solve some pre-selected instances of the puzzle will be awarded the
grand prize (see constest rules for details).

The current prize pool is 2 ETH (approximately $450 USD).

== The main puzzle

This contest's puzzle is inspired by part of a cryptographic operation used
by http://chia.net[Chia] in a 'proof of time' for their cryptocoin.
This is a fascinating subject which you can read more about on their site.
However, this contest will not require any knowledge on such proofs.

The contest problem can be approached with basic algebra skills supplemented
with knowledge of how to solve linear equations involving integers.

What follows is an algebra description of the problem, which skips the deeper
math. For those wanting to explore the details themselves, there is a short
introduction in this document and a reference section at the end with
links to some helpful material.

=== The puzzle setup

Consider a cube with integers on each corner,
and the values labelled stem:[a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h].

Associated with these 8 cube values are three tuples of values
stem:[(A_1,B_1,C_1)], stem:[(A_2,B_2,C_2)], stem:[(A_3,B_3,C_3)],
given by what will be referred to as the *_"cube equations"_*:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{align}
    A_1 &= bc - ad \\
    B_1 &= -ah + bg + cf - de \\
    C_1 &= fg - eh \\
        & \\
    A_2 &= ce - ag \\
    B_2 &= -ah - bg + cf + de \\
    C_2 &= df - bh \\
        &  \\
    A_3 &= be - af \\
    B_3 &= -ah + bg - cf + de\\
    C_3 &= dg - ch \\
\end{align}
++++

Given any cube values stem:[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h], it is clear that the tuple values
stem:[A_1,A_2], etc. are uniquely determined.

What is not obvious from this, is that given any tuple values
stem:[(A_1,B_1,C_1),] stem:[(A_2,B_2,C_2),] stem:[(A_3,B_3,C_3),]
if there is a solution, the cube values
stem:[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h] are uniquely deteremined up to an overall sign.
(A sketch of a proof is provided in xref:algebra-results.adoc['Useful algebra results'].)

So up to an overall sign, a cube can be uniquely referred to by either the
eight corner values or the three tuples.

=== Algorithm to create

In the competition, the goal is to write a python function which will take as
input stem:[(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h)] specifying a cube, with the following additional
guarantees that may make the algebra easier:

* the first two tuples are equal stem:[(A_1,B_1,C_1) = (A_2,B_2,C_2)]
* stem:[B_1^2 - 4 A_1 C_1 = B_2^2 - 4 A_2 C_2 = B_3^2 - 4 A_3 C_3 = -p],
where stem:[p] is a prime and stem:[p -= 7 (mod 8)].

The function must then calculate and return new cube values
latexmath:[(a',b',c',d',e',f',g',h')] such that
[latexmath]
++++
(A'_1,B'_1,C'_1) = (A'_2,B'_2,C'_2) \sim (A_3,B_3,C_3)
++++
with as little computational cost as possible.

This function will be tested by giving it an initial cube and then repeated
application of the function on its own output. So it is also advantageous to
keep the size of the integers in your cube solution from getting larger each
time the function is called.

(As discussed in the xref:skim-math.adoc['Skim Some Deeper Math'] section,
the latexmath:[\sim] in the above equation is
referring to an equivalence relation that gives more freedom in the solution
if desired. The details of this freedom is shown explicitly in
xref:algebra-results.adoc#_equivalence_transformations['Equivalence tranformations'].
While this extra freedom may be helpful,
pursing those details is not strictly required, and replacing the
latexmath:[\sim] with a normal stem:[=] in that equation would still
give acceptible solutions.)
