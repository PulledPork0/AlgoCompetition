inkfish is from https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition.git

It is used to generate test files without reference to this contest's library,
so hopefully provides an independent check of the validity of those answers.
Their methods for creating a pseudo-random sequence of suitable discriminants
for contest data was very convenient and was reused here.
