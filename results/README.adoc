Details of the contest runs can be found in the `result.txt` file under each
algorithm in the results folder. The winning entry rewrote one of the library
routines, which has been pulled out to have the entry all fit in one file. It
has been verified this does not affect the calculated computational cost.

Their improvement was to only do at most, one round of reduction on the result
from the nudupl cube. Usually this is all that is needed, and apparrently
any additional effort is not worth it on average.

Included with their entry is a pdf providing and overview of the math concepts
and a describing their ideas for possible further improvements:
