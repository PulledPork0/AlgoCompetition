The test seed and test values for the competition trials can be found in
`contest.txt`.  Details of the individual contest runs can be found in the
`result.txt` file under each algorithm in the results folder.

The winning entry rewrote one of the library routines, but since it changed
a routine that run_trial itself needed (and also to make it more convenient
for people to read their entry), I pulled out their changes to the library and
combined it with their entry code, thus only needing one file now.
I verified these modifications did not change the output of their
algorithm, and the computational cost matches that of their original entry.

Their improvement was to only do, at most, one round of reduction on the result
from the nudupl cube. Often this is all that is needed to fully reduce the
form, but even in the case the resulting form is not fully reduced, apparently
any additional effort is not worth it on average.

Included with their entry is a pdf providing an overview of the math concepts
and describing their ideas for possible further improvements:
